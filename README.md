### Hi there, I'm Aleksey 👋

I like to learn and teach. Especially, I like to learn how to learn and how to teach 😄

Current projects:
- 🔎 [thelper](https://github.com/kulti/thelper) — Go linter to chech the consistency of test helpers usage.
- 🗒️ [task-list](https://github.com/kulti/task-list) — a personal system to track personal tasks. One day I write an article about it (or make a video).

Further projects:
- 🤖 task-list-bot — the next level of my own task list. Will be packed as telegram bot.
- 🎓 course about pragmatic development — I want to share my experience in development to help others make fewer mistakes.
